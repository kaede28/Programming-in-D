Exercises of the Programming in D book by Ali Ã‡ehreli solved by me, Daniel Vieira - daniel@vieira.pw
The PDF version of this book can be found here: http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/Programming_in_D.pdf

The exercices are separated by groups of folders of Chapters and Sections.

Ali recommends the DMD compiler in order to compile the examples of this book, as all of then were tested against this compiler.

You can get it here: https://dlang.org/download.html. Choose the appropriate version according to your processor type (32 or 64 bits) and operational system.

He also recommends to use the following compiler switches: , -de, -w, -unittest and -run.

-de show use of deprecated features as errors (halt compilation)
-w warnings as errors (compilation will halt)
-unittest compile in unit tests
-run 

Ali also states that we should use a terminal instead of an IDE, so we can get more familiar with the compiling process.
